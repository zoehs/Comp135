        Output measurements ("responses") for all examples of interest.
        Each row is a scalar response for one example.
    n_folds : int
        Number of folds to divide provided dataset into.
    random_state : int or numpy.RandomState instance
        Allows reproducible random splits.
    Returns
    -------
    train_error_per_fold : 1D numpy array, size n_folds
        One entry per fold
        Entry f gives the error computed for train set for fold f

        One entry per fold
        Entry f gives the error computed for test set for fold f

    Guarantees for Return Values
    ----------------------------
    Across all folds, guarantee that no two folds put same object in test set.
    For each fold f, we need to guarantee:
    * The *union* of train_ids_per_fold[f] and test_ids_per_fold[f]
    is equal to [0, 1, ... N-1]
    * The *intersection* of the two is the empty set
    * The total size of train and test ids for any fold is equal to N
