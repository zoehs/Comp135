Implementation TODO list for students for this HW

## Problem 0: Coding tasks

* [  ] Write your `predict` method for LeafNode in tree_utils.py
* [  ] Write your `predict` method for InternalDecisionNode in tree_utils.py
* [  ] Complete the `train_tree_greedy` method in train_tree.py
* [  ] Complete the `select_best_binary_split` method in select_best_binary_split.py


## Problem 1-3: Analysis tasks

* [  ] Do all tasks in the notebook `hw4.ipynb` 

## Files that you do NOT need to touch

* DecisionTreeRegressor.py 
* * Shows how to take all the functionality you'll implement and create an sklearn-like regressor with `fit` and `predict` methods.

* pretty_print_sklearn_tree.py
* * Define helper function for pretty printing binary decision trees.
