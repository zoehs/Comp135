    ''' Train a binary decision tree on provided dataset in greedy fashion.

    Args
    ----
    x_NF : 2D array, shape (N,F) = (n_examples, n_features)
        Training data features to use to build the tree.
    y_N : 1D array, shape (N,) = (n_examples,)
        Training labels to use to build the tree.
    depth : int
        Current depth of the tree. Needed to use as a recursive function.
        Should be zero when called by end user.
    MAX_DEPTH : int
        Hyperparameter controlling maximum allowed depth.
        Smaller values might protect against overfitting.
    MIN_SAMPLES_INTERNAL : int
        Controls minimum samples allowed for an InternalDecisionNode.
        Higher values might protect against overfitting.
    MIN_SAMPLES_LEAF : int
        Hyperparameter controlling minimum samples allowed for a leaf node.
        Higher values might protect against overfitting.

    Returns
    -------
    root_node : an instance of LeafNode or InternalDecisionNode
        This node determines the root of the requested tree.
        You can query its attributes `left_child` and `right_child` to get
        other nodes in the tree (if they exist).
